# Module 3: Reproducible Research and Data Analysis

## Rationale <a name="Rationale"></a>

Reproducible research is at the heart of science. There has been an increased need and willingness to open and share research from the data collection right through to the interpretations of results. This has come with its own set of challenges, which include designing workflows that can be adopted by collaborators in a way that does not compromise the integrity of their contribution. This module will introduce the necessary tools required for transparent reporting which is reproducible and readable.

## Learning outcomes <a name="Learning outcomes"></a>

1. Researchers will be able to describe the key factors that affect the reproducibility of research, including workflow design, data management, and reporting.
1. The researcher will be able to use a range of resources to create and implement a workflow for reproducible research, including using lab notebooks and tools for sharing code and data.
