ONE CLICK! Knit HTML and you're done.
===============================================================

1. Remember how we had to set the directory in Stata? R Projects to the rescue! And it's got version control built right in. Look under Tools>Version Control. (OMG someone build this for Stata plz.)

(If you're doing filepaths by yourself in R, and you're on a Windows machine and you copy-pasted the filepath, change slash directions. Ugh.)

2. Install/Load packages. You only have to install a package once, but you have to load the library every time you want to use it. You'll see that a bunch of ugly commands and output gets displayed. You probably wouldn't really want that in your actual paper.

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, results='hide'}
# Loading required libraries
list.of.packages <- c("foreign", "stargazer", "sandwich", "haven")

# Chicking if library installed, installed if not. 
new.packages <- list.of.packages[!(list.of.packages %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]
if(length(new.packages)) install.packages(new.packages, repos= "http://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu/") 

# Calling libraries 
lapply(list.of.packages, require, character.only = TRUE)
```

Which is why you can turn off code (with echo=FALSE) and/or results (with results='hide'). You're not going to see anything from this chunk here: 

<!-- Note that since Markdown (and R Markdown) is related to HTML, you can put comments in the non-code part of the doc with HTML comment syntax. --> 
```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
# Permanently set echo OFF!
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=FALSE)
pi<-3.14159
print(pi)
```

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

Loading the data
----------------
You can bring in the Stata data directly with the 'foreign' package.

```{r, echo = FALSE }
WASHB<-haven::read_dta("WASHBpublic_mock.dta")
```

Running Analysis
-----------------
I ran some regression analysis. The results are good.
```{r, echo = FALSE}
#Model 1=simple model
model1<-lm(free_chl_yn~treatw, data=WASHB)
#Model 2=with hetero-robust se's--a bit more complicated than Stata
cov <- vcovHC(model1, type = "HC")
robust.se <- sqrt(diag(cov))
#Model 3=add baseline control variables
model3<-lm(free_chl_yn~treatw+kiswahili+english, data=WASHB)
```

Graphics
========
Graphics can be easily inlaid.
Here, I'll make a map of the number of US military recruits to a 16 year period by county.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(haz06~waz06, data=WASHB)
```

Equations
==========
Equations written with LaTeX syntax works, so you can write short reports all in one file.
$$ \frac{dN}{dt} = r * N * (1 - \frac{N}{K})$$

Refer to Values
===============
You can refer to values calculated in R by just surrounding "r" and the code with single accent marks. 
For example, the mean frequency is `r mean(WASHB$treatw, na.rm=TRUE)`.


Simple Output
==============
You can just use built in R functionality.

```{r}
summary(model1)
summary(model3)
```

Fancier Output
==============
Markdown is designed to be simple and also readable by humans in marked-up form. Like I said, mark*down*, not mark*up*. But you can still get really nicely formatted regression output with a couple of R packages, xtable or stargazer. (Very similar to estout or outreg2 in Stata.)

Stargazer has three types of output (text, html, and LaTeX). This file does HTM. For the LaTeX(PDF) version see the file (RMarkdownPDFExample.Rmd). There are very few differences--you pretty much just have to tell stargazer what to expect with the 'type' option and you're done.

RMarkdown-->HTML
---------------
```{r, results='asis'}
stargazer(model1, model1, model3, se=list(NULL, robust.se, NULL), type="html", out="outputR.html", title="Made Automatically in R", align=TRUE, column.labels=c("default","robust", "controls"))
```

Everything All in One Place?
=====================
You can do [citations](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html). Plots, graphs, and citations, what else do you need for a research paper?

Knitr is smart! It doesn't re-run code that hasn't changed, meaning it can be fast. You don't need to worry about re-running your whole paper every time you change a single line of code.

Knitr's predecessor is called Sweave, which is a direct combo of LaTeX and R. So you might want to try that out if you're already a LaTeX pro, but I'm pretty sure Knitr is better.

Send your output to .tex files, include those in your master paper file.
